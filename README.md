## Course Structure

The course will be primarily held online with synchronous sessions, which will be conducted via video conferencing software. These sessions will provide an opportunity for you to engage with the instructor and your peers in real-time and to ask questions and participate in discussions.

For students who are unable to attend the synchronous sessions, video recordings of each session will be made available for asynchronous viewing. These recordings will be posted on the course website shortly after each session and will be accessible to students at any time.

In addition to the synchronous sessions, the course will also include readings, assignments, and might include group projects that will be completed outside of class time. These activities will be posted on the course website, along with clear instructions and deadlines, so that you can follow along and stay on track.

Office hours and online discussions throughout the week can be scheduled based on request.

Overall, the course structure is designed to provide you with flexibility in how you engage with the material and to ensure that everyone can participate fully, regardless of their schedule or location.

## Course Policies

**Communication Channels and Methods**: In this course, communication between the instructor and students will primarily take place through the learning management system (LMS). Students can expect regular updates, announcements, and feedback through the LMS. Synchronous sessions will also be conducted via video conferencing software, and students will receive invitations to these sessions via email. Students are expected to communicate with the instructor in a professional and respectful manner and to adhere to the language and time zone policies established in the syllabus.

**Usage of Digital Tools**: Students are expected to use personal electronic/digital devices such as mobile phones, tablets, laptops, voice recorders, cameras, and camcorders only for educational purposes during class time. Any unauthorized use of these devices, including using them to access social media or other non-educational content, is prohibited. Students should also ensure that their device usage does not disrupt the learning environment or distract other students.

**Assignments and Project Deadline**: Assignments and projects will be submitted through the LMS, and specific instructions and deadlines will be provided for each assignment. Late submissions may be subject to a penalty as specified in the assignment instructions. Students are expected to submit their work on time and to adhere to any formatting or other requirements specified in the instructions.

**Attendance**: Regular attendance is expected in this course, however participation in synchronous sessions is not required. If a student is unable to attend a synchronous session, they can watch the session recordings.

**Disabled Student Support**: Students with disabilities who require accommodations should inform the instructor as soon as possible, and provide documentation of their disability to the university's disability support office. The instructor will work with the disability support office to provide appropriate accommodations as needed.

**Oral and Written Communication Ethics**: Students are expected to use appropriate language and follow ethical guidelines when communicating with the instructor and their peers. All written and oral communication should be respectful, professional, and free of discriminatory or derogatory language. Any violation of these guidelines may result in disciplinary action.

**Privacy and Copyright**: All audio and video shared between the instructor and students or between students in the context of the course are considered personal information and should not be shared or distributed without permission. Students are expected to respect the privacy and copyright of others, and any violation of these policies may result in disciplinary action.

## Course Resources

Throughout this course, students will have access to a variety of resources to support their learning. These resources may include textbooks, articles, online tutorials, videos, and other materials that will be shared via the LMS or during synchronous sessions.

It is important to note that while the instructor will provide guidance and direction on the use of these resources, students are ultimately responsible for managing their own learning and keeping up with course materials. This includes being responsible for reviewing any further announcements or updates posted on the LMS, which may include changes to course resources or other important information.

Additionally, students are responsible for all resources shared during synchronous sessions, including any notes, recordings, or other materials. It is recommended that students review these resources in a timely manner and reach out to the instructor if they have any questions or concerns.

While the instructor will make every effort to provide relevant and useful resources throughout the course, students are encouraged to take an active role in seeking out additional resources that may support their learning. This may include conducting their own research, participating in online forums, or consulting with outside experts in the field of cloud computing.

Overall, the course resources are designed to provide a solid foundation for learning in cloud computing, but it is up to each individual student to take advantage of these resources and to be proactive in managing their own learning.
