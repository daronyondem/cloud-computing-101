# Serverless and App Modernization

Serverless computing and application modernization are paving the way for businesses to harness the full potential of cloud environments, enabling them to achieve greater agility, scalability, and cost-efficiency. This week we will dive deep into serverless computing to unveil its fundamental concepts, advantages, and ideal use cases. We will also discuss the different tools and services provided by leading cloud platforms for crafting serverless solutions.

In the second half of the session, our focus will shift towards application modernization. We will discuss the importance of modernizing legacy applications, identify potential applications that can benefit from modernization, and examine the diverse approaches for carrying out the migration process. In doing so, you will learn how utilizing microservices, containerization, and other core cloud-native patterns can significantly enhance the performance, reliability, and maintainability of modernized applications.

By the end of this week's session, you will have a comprehensive understanding of serverless computing and application modernization, empowering you to design and deploy effective cloud solutions that can adapt and progress in line with evolving business needs.
