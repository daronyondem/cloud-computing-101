# Cloud Native Architectures

Cloud-native architectures are designed to take full advantage of the cloud computing environment, enabling rapid innovation, improved resource utilization, and enhanced operational efficiency. This week, we will delve into the core concepts and components of cloud-native architectures, discussing how they enable organizations to build and deploy applications that can readily adapt to changing requirements and scale on-demand. By understanding the principles and best practices of cloud-native design, you will be better equipped to create applications that fully leverage the power of cloud computing.
