# Week 12 Assignment

## Cloud Solution Architecture Design

### Overview

Design a cloud solution architecture diagram for GRC's application based on the previous assignments, which covered cloud migration, application modernization, hybrid cloud and application integrations, big data and analytics, and AI/ML workloads. The architecture should factor in components and services, their interactions, and justifications for the choices made.

### Instructions

Your task is to create a comprehensive cloud solution architecture that addresses GRC's challenges and goals as specified in the case study. Please adhere to the following guidelines:

1. Use your findings and plans from Assignments 1, 2, and 3 as a foundation for the architecture.
2. Identify the core components and services required to implement the solution across various domains, including compute, storage, database, analytics, AI/ML, and others.
3. Showcase interactions and data flow between the components clearly and efficiently.
4. Choose appropriate cloud services from a major cloud service provider like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform, and justify your selections based on GRC's needs.
5. Implement security best practices throughout the architecture, ensuring data privacy and compliance with regulatory measures.
6. Provide a brief explanation for any trade-offs, compromises, or difficult decisions made during the design process.

### Submission Guidelines:

* Prepare a 2-page report, excluding the title page and references page
* Include a cloud solution architecture diagram
    * Components and services clearly labeled
    * Interactions and data flows represented through arrows or lines
    * Legend/key if necessary, to ensure clarity
* Follow APA 7th Edition formatting
* Use appropriate headings, subheadings, and in-text citations
* Provide a title page and an APA-formatted references page (not included in the 2-page count)
* Use at least three credible sources
