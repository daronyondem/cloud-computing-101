# Intro to Cloud Models

Welcome to Week 1 of our cloud computing course! This week, we will explore the fundamentals of cloud computing and its various service models. We will discuss the three primary cloud service models: Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS). By understanding these models, you will be better equipped to choose the right cloud solution for your organization's needs. We will also cover the various deployment models, such as public, private, hybrid, and multi-cloud strategies. During this week, you will familiarize yourself with key cloud concepts, benefits, and use cases.
