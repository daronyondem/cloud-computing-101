### Cloud Providers and Services

For this final project, you may choose from the following cloud providers to design the Global Retail Company's cloud implementation plan:

* Amazon Web Services (AWS)
* Microsoft Azure
* Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

In your project, consider the unique services and offerings provided by the chosen cloud provider to address GRC's challenges and goals. Additionally, ensure you discuss and compare the cost, performance, and support aspects of the services being proposed.

When designing the cloud implementation plan, consider using the following services and tools offered by the selected cloud provider:

* Compute services (e.g., virtual machines, containers, serverless functions)
* Storage services (e.g., object storage, block storage, file storage)
* Database services (e.g., relational, NoSQL, in-memory databases)
* Big data and analytics services (e.g., data processing, data warehousing, data lakes, machine learning platforms)
* Networking and content delivery services (e.g., virtual networks, load balancers, content delivery networks)
* Security and identity services (e.g., identity and access management, encryption, key management)
* Application integration services (e.g., APIs, messaging, event-driven architectures)
* Management and monitoring services (e.g., logging, monitoring, automation, cost management)
* DevOps tools and services (e.g., continuous integration and continuous delivery pipelines, infrastructure as code, monitoring)

Remember to provide a justification for selecting specific services and tools based on GRC's requirements, goals, and constraints.
